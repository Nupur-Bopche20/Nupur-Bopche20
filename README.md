I am an M.Tech Information Technology scholar at **NIT Raipur**, passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems. My core interests lie in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Full-Stack Development.

I am driven by the challenge of building intelligent systems. I successfully qualified the **GATE (Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering)** to pursue my master's, and I am currently channeling my expertise into my thesis research.

### 🌱 What I'm Currently Working On

My M.Tech research is focused on **Pest Identification and Recommendation Systems**.

* **Goal:** To create a system that helps farmers by automatically identifying crop pests from images (using Computer Vision) and then recommending effective, data-driven solutions and treatments.
* **Tech:** This project involves building and optimizing deep learning models (like CNNs) and developing an accessible interface for practical field use.
<!-- * **Repo:** You can follow the project here: `[Link to Your Pest Project Repo]`  -->
